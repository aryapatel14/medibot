Medi-Bot: 
We have created a health monitoring system that will check all of patients’ vitals through one ‘portable box-kit’. The results will show up on your phone, or any other device that has access to a browser which is useful for any households that have patients with illnesses or diseases.

**Why? 
**There are 750,000 people living with heart failure and 100,000 people that are diagnosed with incurable conditions each year. Statistically, illness is bound to touch one in three Canadians, and most the leading causes of death are commonly related to the non-communicable diseases including respiratory, cardiovascular, heart diseases and the various types of cancer. 

In many households, there are often individuals that are affected by illnesses or the elderly that need to be taken care of cautiously. It is extremely important to monitor vitals and important health parameters regularly to ensure a strong and healthy physical wellbeing. In the fast-paced lifestyles and busy schedules of many, to prevent excessive trips to the doctors, clinics, professionals and to avoid major difficulties, having the access to check your vitals at the ease of your fingertips and the screens of your phones is immensely beneficial and effective.  

**How? Solution?
**With various biomedical innovations and new technologically based machinery, the systems of AI and IOT are becoming a vital revolution in the healthcare industry. Consequently, we are proposing the IOT-Based Health Monitoring System. This Health Monitoring System will essentially be a portable kit that will allow the user/patient to monitor their body temperature, heart rate (BPM), blood oxygen as well as the room temperature and room humidity that can affect how the user is feeling as well. Through incorporating a variety of sensors that will measure/monitor: 
- Body Temperature Sensor
- Pulse Oximeter Sensor Module (measures heart rate & blood oxygen)
- Temperature and Humidity Sensor
